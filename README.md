# OpenPose Installation Guide

## Introduction

This README provides instructions for installing and using OpenPose, an open-source real-time multi-person keypoint detection library for body, face, and hand estimation. The steps outlined here are based on version 1.7.0 of OpenPose.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible operating system (Windows, Ubuntu, or MacOS).
- An internet connection for downloading models and documentation.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download Required Models:**

   - Navigate to the `models` directory in your OpenPose folder.
   - Double-click on `getBaseModels.bat` to download the required body, face, and hand models.

     Optional:
   - Double-click on `models/getCOCO_and_MPII_optional.bat` if you need the COCO and MPII models. Note that these models are slower and less accurate, and should only be downloaded if necessary.

2. **Refer to OpenPose Resources:**

   For detailed information and updates, refer to the OpenPose GitHub pages:
   
   - General information: [OpenPose v1.7.0](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/v1.7.0)
   - Documentation: [OpenPose Documentation](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/v1.7.0/doc/)

3. **C++ Quick Start Guide:**

   Follow the instructions in the C++ quick start guide for basic usage:
   
   - [C++ Quick Start](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/v1.7.0/doc/quick_start.md)

4. **Python Usage:**

   If using Python, consult both the C++ quick start guide and the Python testing documentation:

   - [Python Testing Documentation](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/v1.7.0/doc/modules/python_module.md#testing)

     **Important Note:**
     Replace "cd build/examples/tutorial_api_python" with "cd python/" in the instructions.

     The rest of the `python_module.md` instructions, which are for the GitHub source code library, can be ignored.

   **Python Code Example:**

   ```bash
   cd {OpenPose_root_path}
   cd python/
   python openpose_python.py
   ```

## Additional Notes

- This guide is based on OpenPose version 1.7.0; ensure to check the official repository for any updates or changes.
